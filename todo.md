## [2026-07-02] ACTIVE: v5 promoted to CANONICAL (D41 complete) — remaining: COMMIT, T30 gold set @512, thesis mirror

**STATUS 2026-07-02 (post-Codex):** Codex reviewed v5 → 9 findings, **all verified real and all FIXED** (see PROJECT_LOG §4 2026-07-02 03:00): §6.12/Ch7/Appendix judge prose → 512 run (job 61524); `number_bible_512.py` fixed (runs end-to-end, exit 0); `multiple_comparisons.py` power note now DYNAMIC (512 artifact regenerated; 128 artifact byte-identical); prefix-truncation now committed in `genlen_robustness.json` (`prefix_truncation_128`: 60.3%/30.5%/9.2%); Llama evidence confirmed→directional; composite→side-by-side wording; Qwen-4B deployment claim scoped. **PROMOTION EXECUTED (D40-style full sweep):** `make report` → `build_fyp_report_v5.js`; v3+v4 docx archived to `docs/archive/`; AGENTS/CLAUDE/README/AGENTIC_WORKFLOW/THESIS_OUTLINE/skill/codex-agent/`agent.py`/3 diagram generators → v5; `artifact_policy` extended (immutable manifest **120→300** now pinning `results_512` + `results_sensitivity_512`; report-worthy v5 + `results_512/analysis/*`; **stale-text guard forbids v3/v4-as-current, self-tested**); HANDOFF/dashboard/checklist regenerated. **Gates: `make agent-check` 8/8, pytest 329, guard fires on injected violations.**

**Next steps (ordered):**
1. ✅ ~~COMMIT + push~~ — DONE 2026-07-02: `77468e1` (D41 layer, 219 files; pre-commit review caught a .gitignore bug that would have leaked raw text) + `b7aa53f` (T1/T30 prep). main == origin/main.
2. ✅ ~~T30 tooling~~ — sheet + annotator regenerated from `results_512` (see Watch items). **USER: annotate `human_labels/annotate.html`**, paste back, then `--apply-labels` + `--score` → fold into §6.12/§7.
3. **Thesis mirror to 512 (NEXT BIG BLOCK):** `make thesis` still → `scripts/build_fyp_thesis.js` → `FYP_Thesis_2026-06-18.docx` (128-era). Mirror the v5 512-primary content (same D41 framing + D42 claim-surface sweep from the start) into a new thesis build + archive predecessors + extend the stale-text guard if the filename changes.
4. T1 (READY — user reviews + sends in July; see Watch items), T15, T3.

**Watch items / guardrails:**
- ⚠️ user pasted the OpenAI key in chat (twice) — ROTATE it.
- **T1 READY FOR USER REVIEW (2026-07-02):** the July email (`docs/email_drZhang_july.md`, gitignored; mirrored in `fyp_submission/emails/`) is re-based to 512-primary with the user's framing (spotted the 128 truncation issue → reran everything at 512 → 512 is HarmBench's official budget). The attachment decks `docs/fyp_status_2026-07.html` + `_v2` are REFRESHED to 512 (banners removed; they now pass the stale scan). User: review wording, pick deck (v1 or v2 design), send in July. The OTHER decks (showcase/architecture/meetup/agentic) remain banner-marked 128-era snapshots — refresh before any other presentation.
- **T30 READY FOR ANNOTATION (2026-07-02):** gold-set sheet + in-browser annotator regenerated from the PRIMARY 512 tree (`python scripts/human_label_audit.py --make-sheet && --make-html`, now defaulting to `--results-dir results_512`): 200 rows (120 judge-vs-proxy disagreement + 80 agreement, all 10 NF4 aliases, max response 2 000 chars). User: open `human_labels/annotate.html`, label 0/1, click Finish & export → Copy results → paste back; then `--apply-labels` + `--score` → `results_512/analysis/human_validation.json` → fold into §6.12/§7.
- `docs/agentic report`/architecture .svg/.drawio emitted artifacts still show old builder node labels (regen optional, guard is verb-anchored — same as D40).
- 128 artifacts (`results/`, `results/analysis/`) are retained UNCHANGED as the comparison; never clobber.

**Prior context:** the original re-base plan that this entry supersedes was fully executed on 2026-07-01/02 — Ch6 prose, figures, §6.15/§6.16, appendix, infra promotion, and the 3-round + Codex verification are ALL DONE (durable record: PROJECT_LOG §4 rows 2026-07-01 22:15 → 2026-07-02). Numbers source: `results_512/analysis/` via `python scripts/number_bible_512.py`.

---

## [2026-06-30] ✅ DONE: promote 512-token to PRIMARY — full apparatus at 512

All phases executed (TC1 INT8/multi-seed runs, SCP, local analysis, Phase G re-base, D41 promotion). Durable record: PROJECT_LOG §3 D41 + §4 rows 2026-06-30 → 2026-07-02. Only Phase F (T30 gold set @512) remains — tracked in the top entry.

---

## [2026-06-29] ✅ DONE: T31 — full 512-token rerun (phases A→E, G complete; F pending)

Superseded by the entries above; durable record in PROJECT_LOG (D39/D41, §4). Phase F (T30 @512) tracked in the top entry.

## [2026-06-26] ACTIVE: send the JULY follow-up email + attach the July status deck (staged for a July send)

**Why:** Deliberate pacing of supervisor updates. The June progress update was SENT 2026-06-13 (completed 3-pair results, expansion framed as "next steps"). The follow-up reporting the completed extensions is drafted and its companion deck is built; hold it for a July send. This item is the send action.

**Source of truth:** `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` §1 + T1.

**Decided (don't re-litigate):**
- Pacing: June sent now (done), completed-expansion update held for July. (User strategy.)
- Email file naming = month, not date: `email_drZhang_june.md` / `email_drZhang_july.md`.
- Deck identity = editorial whitepaper (Newsreader / Spline Sans / IBM Plex Mono, ruled-paper bg, indigo+gold), light-first. (User chose after rejecting the recolor-only + the showcase-lookalike fonts.)

**Verification already done:**
- June email SENT 2026-06-13; as-sent text saved verbatim to `docs/email_drZhang_june.md`.
- July deck verified in Claude preview 2026-06-26 (design); COPY re-based to 512-primary 2026-07-02 (14 replacements/deck, passes the stale scan) — re-verify rendering once before sending.

**Next steps (ordered, concrete):**
1. When ready (July), send the body of `docs/email_drZhang_july.md` to `jiehuang.zhang@ntu.edu.sg` — subject `FYP July Progress Update: full 512-token rerun, revised headline (CCDS25-1136)`.
2. ATTACH `docs/fyp_status_2026-07.html` or `_v2` (both REFRESHED to 512-primary on 2026-07-02; pick the design you prefer). Do NOT attach `docs/fyp_status_2026-06-13.html` (June 3-pair deck — already sent with June).
3. If NTU mail strips/blocks the `.html` attachment: zip it or export to PDF first.
4. After sending: add a PROJECT_LOG §4 row (July sent) + tick T1; mark `docs/email_drZhang_july.md`'s header note SENT (like the June file).

**Watch items / guardrails:**
- Both email md files are gitignored (`docs/email_*.md`) — keep local; repo is PUBLIC.
- Don't cross the decks: July email ↔ `fyp_status_2026-07.html`; June email ↔ `fyp_status_2026-06-13.html`.
- The deck shows Mistral/Phi on the safety axis only (no fabricated ΔMMLU) — if adding capability columns, pull from `results/analysis/*.csv`.

**Ready-to-paste:**
- To: `jiehuang.zhang@ntu.edu.sg`
- Subject: `FYP July Progress Update: full 512-token rerun, revised headline (CCDS25-1136)`
- Body: `docs/email_drZhang_july.md`  ·  Attach: `docs/fyp_status_2026-07.html`

## [2026-06-18] ACTIVE: submission wrap-up — the study is COMPLETE; only the two submission tasks remain

**Source of truth:** `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` §1 status + D35 (INT8) + D36 (audit). All experiments, code, report, deliverables, and the standalone thesis are done and on `main` (run `git status -sb` for the live sync state). 329 tests; `make agent-check` 8/8.

**Do next, in order:**
1. **T1 — email Dr. Zhang.** June update SENT 2026-06-13 (as-sent record `docs/email_drZhang_june.md`). Remaining: send the staged July follow-up + its deck — see the **[2026-06-26]** entry at the top.
2. **T15 — submit.** Two documents exist: the interim report `docs/FYP_Report_2026-07-01_v5.docx` (`make report`; 512-primary, D41) and the NEW standalone thesis `docs/FYP_Thesis_2026-06-18.docx` (`make thesis`; IEEE-cited, sources verified). Decide which the milestone requires; the thesis cover says "Final Report — Thesis" (one-line change in `scripts/build_fyp_thesis.js` if it's actually the interim).
3. **T3 — `MyTCinfo`** on TC1 (storage quota). Quick, optional.

**Optional disclosure polish (low; already partly covered in §7.5/Ch8 — do only if tightening for the viva):**
- One-line XSTest-ΔOR construct-validity note where ΔOR is reported (the over-refusal regex was never judge-validated; same over-counting risk as HarmBench). Esp. the Phi −0.028 claim.
- "HarmBench classifier adopted as reference without independent human-label validation" disclosure (the gpt-4o 2nd judge κ 0.69–0.94 is the partial cross-check).
- `max_new_tokens=128` ASR-floor note (MMLU-truncation already disclosed in Ch8).

**Optional research follow-ups (Ch9 future work; not blocking submission):**
- Replicate the §6.15 Llama-3B INT8 ASR effect across more models + decode seeds (it rests on ≈8–9 prompts, one pair, non-monotonic — establish if it's a general LLM.int8 phenomenon).
- Trace the §6.14 first-token refusal-margin probe across all three precisions (fp16/INT8/NF4), not just the behavioural metrics.
- Add a genuinely different quant family (GPTQ / AWQ / GGUF) beyond the two bitsandbytes methods.
- Arditi activation-direction probe; paired neutral-margin control with a significance test.

**Standalone thesis — DONE 2026-06-18:** new `scripts/build_fyp_thesis.js` (`make thesis`) → `docs/FYP_Thesis_2026-06-18.docx` (24 pp, Times New Roman, full front matter + 10 chapters + 7 tables + IEEE references + appendices). SEPARATE from the interim report (`make report` never touches it). **IEEE done:** numbered `[n]` in-text citations + reference list by citation order; **all 18 sources browsed/verified against arXiv (none hallucinated)** — see PROJECT_LOG §4 rows (2026-06-18 20:45 / 21:15). Optional thesis polish if tightening for submission (don't re-research): (a) the RQs render as "1. RQ1: …" (drop the redundant list number → plain "RQ1: …" by switching the `NUM(...,"rq")` calls to `PJ`); (b) expand any chapter (it's ~5,100 words, complete-but-concise — interim report has the deeper §6 detail); (c) double-check the two PLOS journal page numbers ([16] Sandve, [17] Wilson) and the full author lists behind the "et al." entries; (d) `make thesis` after any edit, then re-validate.

**Reuse/dissemination deliverables — DONE 2026-06-18 (research-grounded):** `pip install -e .` packaging (`pyproject.toml`) + `CITATION.cff` + `docs/QUICKSTART.md` (framework reuse), `docs/paper_outline.md` (workshop paper/poster), `docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md` + `docs/RESULTS_CARD.md`, `docs/THESIS_OUTLINE.md`. README links them all. ⚠️ **ACTION (user decision): add a `LICENSE`** — the repo is currently all-rights-reserved, which blocks reuse. Recommend MIT or Apache-2.0 for the code, but **confirm against NTU FYP intellectual-property policy first** (FYP IP may be co-owned). Then set `license` in `pyproject.toml` + `CITATION.cff`, and optionally archive a release to Zenodo for a citable DOI. See `docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md` §6.

**Housekeeping (optional):** stale local branches already merged to main can be pruned — `t26-add-mistral-phi-pairs`, `mechanism-refusal-margin`, `int8-precision-point`, `harden/latent-six-audit`, `backup/pre-v2-scorer-final` (keep `backup/*` if wanted as a safety net).

## [2026-06-18] ✅ DONE: full-repo scorer-integrity + consistency audit (D36)

6-dimension adversarial audit (the student's worry: did v1/v2 + the classifier-primary switch corrupt the old/NF4 results?). **Verdict: NOTHING invalidates the results** — every primary HarmBench ASR is classifier-scored and independent of the regex; the main pipeline + `pairwise_deltas.json` carry the V2 (not v1) proxy; 120 raw artifacts hash-match; redaction + matched-pair integrity clean; reproduced Qwen-1.7B +0.055 and Llama INT8 +0.040 byte-for-byte. Applied the non-invalidating fixes (§6.5 family-wise caveat, stale §6.1.1 opening, dir-tree 22→23, κ 0.69→0.68, sensitivity `_v2_asr`→v2 + loader raise guard, +6 tests → 295, PROJECT_LOG §1). Durable record: PROJECT_LOG D36. Nothing left to do.

## [2026-06-18] ✅ DONE: T29 — INT8 precision point RUN COMPLETE + merged to main `48330d4` (D35, report §6.15)

Ran 5 `*_8bit` matrix + INT8 classifier judge on TC1 + gpt-4o 2nd judge (0 parse errors). **Finding (NOT bit-width-graded):** capability = clean cliff at 4-bit; safety = two-peaked/method-specific — Qwen-1.7B @ NF4 (+0.055, judge-dependent) and **Llama-3B @ INT8 (+0.040, both-judge + McNemar sig, non-monotonic** — most judge-robust move, caveated). Full-parity INT8 diagnostics (scoped `*_int8`, zero drift); fixed a latent v1/v2 sweep-column bug. Durable record: PROJECT_LOG D35. Nothing left to do.

## [2026-06-15] ✅ DONE: T28 — refusal-margin mechanism probe (the "why"); merged to main `c67dbe8` (D33, report §6.14)

Honest finding: **boundary instability, NOT targeted erosion** (within-family AUC 0.64; symmetric 50 harmful-ward / 42 safe-ward flips; flip-driving Qwen-1.7B = generic softening → capability-driven, supports the dichotomy). Overclaimed first; the adversarial-verify workflow deflated it → reported caveated. Durable record: PROJECT_LOG D33. Nothing left to do.

## [2026-06-15] ✅ DONE: T26 — Mistral-7B + Phi-4-mini RUN COMPLETE + folded into report (commit `19a3345`, merged to main; durable record = PROJECT_LOG D32)

**Source of truth:** `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` — D30 + §4 row (2026-06-14 23:45). This entry is only the "how to resume the RUN" buffer.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-15. Ran on TC1 (matrix 61121/61122/61123/61125 + HarmBench classifier 61134) + gpt-4o 2nd judge (local). Judge-primary: Mistral ΔASR **−0.040** (n.s.; v2 proxy +0.055 sign-flip, κ 0.11–0.19; gpt-4o concurs −0.030/κ 0.60–0.63), Phi ΔASR **0.000** (robust_preservation; ΔOR −0.028 SIG decrease). No new significant ΔASR (Qwen 1.7B stays the only one); D16's judge-over-proxy finding now spans 4 families. Folded into report (new §6.13 + Tables 6.1–6.3 + Abstract/RQ2/RQ5/§6.11/§6.4.1/§6.12/Ch10); manifest 48→80; 246 tests + `make agent-check` 8/8 + 3-agent adversarial verification (36/36 numeric checks) all green; Phi via native Phi3 (D31). Committed `19a3345`, **merged to main + pushed**. **Durable record: PROJECT_LOG.md D32.** Everything below is retained for reference only — nothing left to do for T26.

**Why:** 3 pairs/2 families → 5 pairs/4 families (add `mistral_7b`, `phi4_mini`) for cross-family generality (RQ5) + small-model deployment. IDENTICAL methodology to the old 3 (NF4, greedy, seed 42, 4 benchmarks incl. ARC, HarmBench classifier as PRIMARY ASR).

**Decided (don't re-litigate):**
- **gpt-4o 2nd judge → YES** on both new pairs (full W3 parity). Runs LOCALLY on the Mac (needs internet/`OPENAI_API_KEY`), NOT on TC1 (offline).
- **Mistral-7B 6h/10G fit → decide at smoke time** (measure, then bump `slurm.time` only if it times out).
- **cross-family → all-pairs matrix** (done; `compute_cross_family_consistency`).
- **v2 refusal proxy → KEEP and run on the new pairs.** It is the flawed-baseline FOIL that proves the judge-validation contribution (§6.12 / Table 6.3 κ), not a metric we trust. User asked whether to delete it (even from the old 3) → decided NO: deleting removes the evidence for the study's headline methodological finding ("the regex over-counts; the judge relocated the significant result"). Per-family κ on the new pairs is itself a finding. Optional later: demote its prominence in tables (presentation only), never delete.
- **attn_implementation validator** → added, fail-loud (`eager`/`sdpa`/`flash_attention_2` only).

**Rejected (don't re-litigate):**
- Gemma-3-4b / Ministral-3-3b — multimodal, not `AutoModelForCausalLM`.
- AWQ — V100 sm_70 can't run AutoAWQ GEMM kernels.
- **Multi-seed sensitivity for the new pairs up front** — it was only ever run on Qwen 1.7B (the headline pair); Qwen 4B + Llama are greedy-only. **RULE:** run multi-seed on a new pair ONLY IF its results make it a headline (significant/borderline ΔASR), mirroring why Qwen 1.7B got it. `tc1_sensitivity.yaml` stays at its current pairs (do not add the new pairs now).

**Verification already done (don't repeat):** configs load → 10 models/5 pairs/4 families + correct per-family flags; loader injects `attn_implementation` only when set (omitted-when-None test); 246 tests + `make agent-check` 8/8; 4 matrix + 4 smoke sbatch are byte-consistent with the committed `qwen_2b_base` templates (alias-only diff); `judge_validation_newpairs.sbatch` targets only the 4 new aliases; existing config entries + NF4/decode/seed/chat-template code byte-unchanged; immutable artifacts not reopened.

**Next steps — RUN (TC1 head node; identical copy-paste guide in CLAUDE.md / README):**
0. PRE-FLIGHT (browser): accept the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 license on huggingface.co under account `ueihorng` (gated). Phi-4-mini = MIT/ungated.
1. `cd /tc1home/FYP/utan001/fyp_quant/repo && git fetch origin && git checkout t26-add-mistral-phi-pairs && git pull --ff-only origin t26-add-mistral-phi-pairs` (expect `60c0acc`).
2. `huggingface-cli login` (re-login harmless; needed for the gated Mistral download).
3. `make prefetch CONFIG=configs/tc1.yaml` (fetches the 2 new model_ids; judge classifier already cached from job 61047).
4. **Smoke (gate):** `sbatch slurm/jobs_tc1_smoke/mistral_7b_base__harmbench.sbatch` + `…/phi4_mini_base__harmbench.sbatch`. Verify `.err` clean + `summary.json` has metrics + a response looks coherent (`head -c 600 results/<m>/harmbench/raw.jsonl`). STOP if Phi errors on eager/trust_remote_code or anything OOMs.
5. **Matrix Mistral:** `sbatch slurm/jobs_tc1/mistral_7b_base__matrix.sbatch` + `…/mistral_7b_4bit__matrix.sbatch`. Wait both `COMPLETED` (`squeue -u utan001`; `seff <jobid>` — watch the 6h walltime on the 7.2B base).
6. **Matrix Phi:** `sbatch slurm/jobs_tc1/phi4_mini_base__matrix.sbatch` + `…/phi4_mini_4bit__matrix.sbatch`.
7. **Judge (PRIMARY ASR):** after ALL 4 matrix jobs COMPLETE → `sbatch slurm/judge_validation_newpairs.sbatch` (fp16; scores ONLY the 4 new aliases → old-6 sidecars untouched). Must run AFTER the matrix (reads `raw.jsonl`; crashes if absent).

**Next steps — POST-RUN (Mac, after SCP back; ping Claude to drive this):**
8. `rsync` the 4 new `results/{mistral_7b_base,mistral_7b_4bit,phi4_mini_base,phi4_mini_4bit}/` dirs back from TC1.
9. `make analyze` + `python scripts/{judge_agreement,judge_pairwise_agreement,harmbench_category_breakdown,mmlu_subject_breakdown,rescore_harmbench}.py`.
10. gpt-4o 2nd judge (local, needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `~/.zshrc`): `python scripts/run_judge_validation.py --backend api_judge --models mistral_7b_base mistral_7b_4bit phi4_mini_base phi4_mini_4bit`, then `python scripts/judge_pairwise_agreement.py`.
11. ~~(executed 2026-06-15, T26/D32; builder since superseded by v5)~~ Fold REAL numbers into the report builder (Tables 6.1/6.2/6.3, §6.11 cross-family, §6.4.1 ARC, Abstract, RQ5/Ch10) → `make report`. Add PROJECT_LOG run-results D-decision + §4 row. `python scripts/agent_check.py --write-immutable-manifest` (ADD new raw hashes, never overwrite). `make agent-check`. Then merge branch → main.

**Watch items / guardrails:**
- **Mistral 7.2B vs 6h walltime / 10G mem** — the binding risk. If `TIMEOUT`, bump `slurm.time` (+ regenerate, or hand-edit the 2 mistral sbatch) — decoding/seed/NF4/n unaffected, so fairness holds.
- **Phi-4-mini** eager + trust_remote_code only exercise on the V100 — the smoke is the gate.
- **Mistral HF-gated** → license + login before prefetch (offline compute nodes fail closed).
- **Judge AFTER matrix** (`run_judge_validation` FileNotFoundError on missing `raw.jsonl`).
- **DON'T touch:** old `raw.jsonl`/`summary.json`/`scores.*` sidecars (immutable TC1 originals); `tc1_sensitivity.yaml` (separate D23 study, stays as-is); no raw HarmBench prompt/response text in any doc.
- **Expected non-bug:** post-run `make analyze` restructures `quantization_analysis_summary.json`'s `cross_family` section to the all-pairs shape (`<famA>__vs__<famB>` + `overall_sign_consistency`); the existing qwen-vs-llama leaf numbers are byte-identical.
